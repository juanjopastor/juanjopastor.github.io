__AI to the rescue!__ I wanted to try out that fancy generative AI stuff for coding, so I jumped in with a stopwatch project. Since I couldn't snag a free GitHub Copilot thing, I went with Google Gemini.

### programming languaje

I went with **JavaScript** for this project because:

-   __Works everywhere:__ You can use it on any browser or phone, awesome!
-   __Easy to learn:__ I didn't know any JavaScript, but I got the hang of it quickly.
-   __Very versatile:__ It lets you create cool and interactive stuff, perfect for a stopwatch.
-   __Lots of help available:__ If I run into any problems, there are many JavaScript experts who can lend a hand.

### process

- __I asked for the whole app and then kept asking for changes.__ I knew other programming languages, and I could understand the code and explanations, so I could make the changes myself.
- __Big mistake: I asked in Spanish.__ That meant the code ended up with a mix of languages, which I had to fix later.
- __In a nutshell:__ I used my coding skills and the AI's help to make the stopwatch app.

Hope you liked it. But remember, Google Gemini wrote this article too!
